# DataStructureDesign

This project represents the final output of the Data Structures course design for the Summer 2022 short semester at Tongji University. It comprises the implementation of solutions for two distinct problems, both developed using the QT framework.

## Algorithm Implementation: Binary Tree Operations

The first problem addressed was an algorithm implementation task focusing on binary trees. This section of the project successfully implemented the creation of binary trees and provided functionalities for their pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals. Furthermore, it included the creation of pre-order, in-order, and post-order threaded binary trees, along with the corresponding traversal methods for pre-order and in-order threaded structures. Finally, the implementation also features a function to count the number of leaf nodes within a given binary tree. All these functionalities are integrated into a standard interactive graphical user interface built with QT, offering a user-friendly platform to interact with these fundamental tree operations.

## Comprehensive Application: Social Network Analysis

The second problem tackled was a comprehensive application task centered around social network analysis. This part of the project implemented the graphical display of an individual's social network, allowing for a visual representation of connections between individuals. Additionally, it implemented the capability to identify potential acquaintances for a specified person and to determine the degree of connection to these individuals within the network. The application also includes a feature to sort these potential acquaintances based on their calculated connection degree and to output the ordered results. Similar to the first problem, all these features are presented through a standard interactive graphical user interface developed using the QT framework, providing a comprehensive tool for exploring social network relationships.
